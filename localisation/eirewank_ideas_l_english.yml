 irish_endurance_desc: "Life for many centuries has been a harsh and violent thing for Irish people. Farming has been difficult and life short as famine, warfare and disease claimed the lives of much of Ireland's best and brightest. Yet out of this was bred a tough people, one ready to survive most of what the world could throw at them and survive it with song and mirth. Yes, there is no stronger man on God's green earth than an Irishman!"
 the_clanns: "The Clanns"

In smaller families, the family elected chieftain is in charge of maintaining the family and protecting their lands. Land and leadership is passed through the family electorate system of Tanistry. From the royal clanns the symbolic high king of Ireland is elected, creating a bond of union between the Irish families."

 loyal_catholics: "Land of Saints and Scholars"
 loyal_catholics_desc: ""Ireland in centuries past was famed for being the Land of Saints and Scholars, where a strong Monastical tradition took hold and produced the finest Christian works of art of the Dark Ages, standing as a beacon of Christian piety in a time of Pagan invasion. This tradition has been long forgotten however there is great interest in reviving it in Ireland, perhaps we should not only encourage it as a pious and cultural endeavour, but embrace it as a part of our national identity."

 unconquerable_ireland_desc: "The Ó Mháille Clan has had a long history of seafaring, based out of Rockfleet Castle in Co. Mayo. We should not let their great experience and fine traditions go to waste by establishing a prestigious Naval Academy from which all our up and coming Admirals and Commodores shall learn from Ireland's best."

 ire_abundant_harvests: "Abundant Harvests"
 ire_abundant_harvests_desc: "Now that the age of warfare and strife is ending in Ireland as the Kingdom is consolidated, our farmers are finally able to manage their produce in peace. Destruction of crops, cattle raids and the devastation of war are now a distant thing in from the Irish countryside and this has never been more clear than the ever-growing stocks in our granaries."
